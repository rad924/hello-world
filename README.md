Hello fellow Coders!

Robert here, I have experience with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, C#. I have built a MySQL Client database along with an intranet site for the company so employees can readily access client information. I was tasked with and completed the creation of a C# Windows Forms application which was a automated juror check-in station in which jurors scan either the barcode on the summons or scan the 2D barcode on the driver license to check-in for jury duty.
